# Network Scanning Tools

## Objective

Network Scanning Tools creation project is aimed at developing a comprehensive set of custom network analysis tools, including a port scanner, unthreaded UDP ping tool, and ICMP traceroute utility, to enhance my skills as a cybersecurity analyst. These tools will aid in identifying vulnerabilities, analyzing network traffic, and strengthening defenses against potential threats, aligning with the responsibilities of monitoring and protecting organizational systems. This tools were designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.

### Skills Learned

- Cybersecurity Threat Mitigation: Learnt to identify and address vulnerabilities like open ports, exposed services, and weak network configurations.
- Ethical Hacking Practices: Understanding how to responsibly use scanning tools for vulnerability assessments.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Github
- pycharm

## Steps

## Port Scanner
Using python I was able to create a simple port scanner using multi-threading
